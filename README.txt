This repository is a way of tracking my progress while independantly learning numerical solutions to differential equations.

I will largely be using python to complete this project, and personally I have a stron preferance for using jupyter notebooks, however
I understand that not everyone likes jupyter notebooks so I will be including finalized version of the notebooks as raw .py files

I am trying to produce intuitive code for the user to use, however I know that I am really making this for me and will thus use my own coding
preferences/practices for creating these files. Hopefully I can create something thats useful to someone else!
